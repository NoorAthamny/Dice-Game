# Dice Game

## About This Project

This project began as a simple game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As my first React project, converting it to React was a challenging experience, especially around using props and managing JavaScript logic within the React framework. I used ChatGPT to help me navigate these new concepts and successfully refactor the code into reusable React components.

## How to Play

1. **Game Setup**: Each player starts with a score of 0.
2. **Taking Turns**: Players take turns rolling two dice. The sum of the dice rolls adds to the player’s current score.
3. **Dice Rolling Rules**:
   - If a player rolls two identical numbers (doubles), their turn ends immediately, and their current score resets to 0.
4. **Hold Button**: When a player clicks the “Hold” button, their current score is added to their total score, and it becomes the next player’s turn.
5. **Winning Condition**: The first player to reach or exceed a score of 100 wins the game.
6. **New Game Button**: Clicking this button resets the game, scores, and player states for a fresh start.
